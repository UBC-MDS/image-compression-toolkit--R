In the interest of creating such an environment, we as contributors pledge that we will be dedicated to keeping the working environment harassment-free, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, body, size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. Be kind and do not put anyone down.

- Be friendly and welcoming
- Using inclusive language
- Be patient and respectful, especially with difference in opinions
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Unconstructive criticism
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

It is very important that we deal incidents publicly, so please report any unacceptable behaviors by opening up an issues on the project repository or by contacting a project maintainer.
